class Watcher:
    """
    The :class:`Watcher` is in charge of watching for channel breaches for the appointments accepted by the tower.

    The :class:`Watcher` keeps track of the accepted appointments in ``appointments`` and, for new received block,
    checks if any breach has happened by comparing the txids with the appointment locators. If a breach is seen, the
    ``encrypted_blob`` of the corresponding appointment is decrypted and the data is passed to the
    :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`.

    If an appointment reaches its end with no breach, the data is simply deleted.

    The :class:`Watcher` receives information about new received blocks via the ``block_queue`` that is populated by the
    :obj:`ChainMonitor <teos.chain_monitor.ChainMonitor>`.

    Args:
        db_manager (:obj:`AppointmentsDBM <teos.appointments_dbm.AppointmentsDBM>`): a ``AppointmentsDBM`` instance
            to interact with the database.
        block_processor (:obj:`BlockProcessor <teos.block_processor.BlockProcessor>`): a ``BlockProcessor`` instance to
            get block from bitcoind.
        responder (:obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`): a ``Responder`` instance.
        sk_der (:obj:`bytes`): a DER encoded private key used to sign appointment receipts (signaling acceptance).
        max_appointments (:obj:`int`): the maximum amount of appointments accepted by the ``Watcher`` at the same time.
        expiry_delta (:obj:`int`): the additional time the ``Watcher`` will keep an expired appointment around.

    Attributes:
        appointments (:obj:`dict`): a dictionary containing a summary of the appointments (:obj:`Appointment
            <teos.appointment.Appointment>` instances) accepted by the tower (``locator``, ``end_time``, and ``size``).
            It's populated trough ``add_appointment``.
        locator_uuid_map (:obj:`dict`): a ``locator:uuid`` map used to allow the :obj:`Watcher` to deal with several
            appointments with the same ``locator``.
        block_queue (:obj:`Queue`): A queue used by the :obj:`Watcher` to receive block hashes from ``bitcoind``. It is
        populated by the :obj:`ChainMonitor <teos.chain_monitor.ChainMonitor>`.
        db_manager (:obj:`AppointmentsDBM <teos.appointments_dbm.AppointmentsDBM>`): a ``AppointmentsDBM`` instance
            to interact with the database.
        block_processor (:obj:`BlockProcessor <teos.block_processor.BlockProcessor>`): a ``BlockProcessor`` instance to
            get block from bitcoind.
        responder (:obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`): a ``Responder`` instance.
        signing_key (:mod:`PrivateKey`): a private key used to sign accepted appointments.
        max_appointments (:obj:`int`): the maximum amount of appointments accepted by the ``Watcher`` at the same time.
        expiry_delta (:obj:`int`): the additional time the ``Watcher`` will keep an expired appointment around.

    Raises:
        :obj:`InvalidKey <common.exceptions.InvalidKey>`: if teos sk cannot be loaded.

        Adds a new appointment to the ``appointments`` dictionary if ``max_appointments`` has not been reached.

        ``add_appointment`` is the entry point of the ``Watcher``. Upon receiving a new appointment it will start
        monitoring the blockchain (``do_watch``) until ``appointments`` is empty.

        Once a breach is seen on the blockchain, the :obj:`Watcher` will decrypt the corresponding ``encrypted_blob``
        and pass the information to the :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`.

        The tower may store multiple appointments with the same ``locator`` to avoid DoS attacks based on data
        rewriting. `locators`` should be derived from the ``dispute_txid``, but that task is performed by the user, and
        the tower has no way of verifying whether or not they have been properly derived. Therefore, appointments are
        identified by ``uuid`` and stored in ``appointments`` and ``locator_uuid_map``.
